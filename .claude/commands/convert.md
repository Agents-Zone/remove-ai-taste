# Instructions

## Step 1 — Locate the article

Detect article directory from current working directory or ask the user.
Detect persona — try in this order:
1. Walk up the directory tree looking for a `.persona` file; read its first line
2. If the current path contains a directory name matching one in `personas/` → use that persona
3. Ask the user

Verify `draft.md` (or `final.md`) exists. Read it fully — you'll need it for the LLM steps.

## Step 2 — Run all scripts

**IMPORTANT: Images must be generated BEFORE WeChat HTML**, because the weixin converter embeds section images inline in the HTML.

### 2a — Images (run first)
```bash
python scripts/writing/image_generator.py <article_dir> --persona <persona>
```
Generates 5 images into `<article_dir>/images/`. Must complete before 2b.

### 2b — WeChat HTML (after images are ready)
```bash
python scripts/writing/article_converter.py weixin <article_dir>
```
Extracts links → reference list, runs html_converter, injects section images as base64 into the HTML, writes `weixin.html`.

**WeChat HTML behaviour:**
- Title is extracted from h1 and **not included** in the styled body (user pastes it into WeChat title field separately)
- Section images (`section-1.jpg`, `section-2.jpg`, etc.) are embedded inline before h2 headings
- Cover image (`cover-weixin.jpg`) is uploaded separately as the WeChat cover

### 2c — Zhihu markdown (can run in parallel with 2a)
```bash
python scripts/writing/article_converter.py zhihu <article_dir>
```
Cleans markdown, adds footer, writes `zhihu.md`.

Run 2a first, then 2b. 2c can run in parallel with 2a. Report any errors before continuing.

## Step 3 — XHS adaptation (LLM)

Read `writing/templates/platform-adapters/xhs-adapter.md` for full rules.

Adapt the article for XHS (小红书):
- **Short format** (≤600 chars): Title ≤20 chars, body 300-600 chars, 3-5 punchy paragraphs
- **Long format** (600+ chars): Full article format allowed, with hashtags at end
- **Both formats**: No inline links, no headings, no emoji, first-person "分享" energy
- **Hashtags**: 5-8 tags at end (2-3 topic, 2-3 niche, 1-2 emotion/behaviour)

Choose the format that best fits the content. XHS supports both short and long articles.

Write to `<article_dir>/xhs.md`.

## Step 4 — English translation (LLM)

Follow all rules in `.claude/commands/english.md`.

Key rules:
- Aggressive cutting — English version noticeably shorter
- Replace WeChat links with English sources
- Adapt Chinese-specific examples for international readers
- Proper frontmatter (title, date, author, category, description)
- End with: `---\n\n*Originally written in Chinese. Translated by the author.*`

Write to `<article_dir>/english.md`.

## Step 5 — Report

```
✓ Conversion complete: [article title]

Scripts ran:
  weixin.html    — WeChat HTML, [N] links moved to references
  zhihu.md       — [N] chars
  images/        — [N] images generated (cover-xhs 3:4, cover-weixin 16:9, section-N 1:1)

LLM outputs:
  xhs.md         — [N] chars, [N] hashtags
  english.md     — [N] words, [N] WeChat links replaced

Run /publish to distribute.
```

# Important

- Scripts must run successfully before LLM steps — if a script fails, diagnose and fix
- NEVER fabricate data in any adapted version
- `english.md` goes to the article directory, not `posts/`
- If `images/` generation fails on some images, note it but continue — partial image sets are fine
